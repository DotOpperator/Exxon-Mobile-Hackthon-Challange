# HackathonProjects

This repository includes our mini project started and completed at the hackathon: HackHers-2019

This mini project is about reading CSV files and store data in the database, utilizing mysql.

This open challenge was from Exxon Mobil, who were open to what we can do with the data provided by them.

We attempted to reorganize the given data and make better tables and relationships and avoid redundancy.
